Apollo configuration is stored as a plain object in an `apollo.config.js` file which exports the configuration. For more information about configuring an Apollo project, see: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/devtools/apollo-config/.\n\n> Note: the use of the `apollo` key in the project's package.json file for configuration is deprecated, and will no longer be supported in Apollo v3\n\nYou'll need to set up your Apollo configuration for all the features of the Apollo CLI and VS Code extension to work correctly. For full details on how to do that, [visit our docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/devtools/apollo-config/). A basic configuration (`apollo.config.js` style) looks something like this:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  client: {\n    name: \"My Client Project\",\n    service: \"my-service-name\"\n  }\n};\n```\n\n# Code Generation\n\n## Accompanying Libraries\n\nSee [Apollo iOS](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios) for details on the mapping from GraphQL results to Swift types, as well as runtime support for executing queries and mutations. For Scala, see [React Apollo Scala.js](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo-scalajs) for details on how to use generated Scala code in a Scala.js app with Apollo Client.\n\n## `gql` template support\n\nIf the source file for generation is a JavaScript or TypeScript file, the codegen will try to extrapolate the queries inside the [gql tag](https://github.com/apollographql/graphql-tag) templates.\n\nThe tag name is configurable using the CLI `--tagName` option.\n\n## Typescript and Flow\n\nWhen using the codegen command with Typescript or Flow, make sure to add the `__typename` introspection field to every selection set within your graphql operations.\n\nIf you're using a client like `apollo-client` that does this automatically for your GraphQL operations, pass in the `--addTypename` option to `apollo codegen:generate` to make sure the generated Typescript and Flow types have the `__typename` field as well. This is required to ensure proper type generation support for `GraphQLUnionType` and `GraphQLInterfaceType` fields.\n\n## Why is the \\_\\_typename field required?\n\nUsing the type information from the GraphQL schema, we can infer the possible types for fields. However, in the case of a `GraphQLUnionType` or `GraphQLInterfaceType`, there are multiple types that are possible for that field. This is best modeled using a disjoint union with the `__typename`\nas the discriminant.\n\nFor example, given a schema:\n\n```graphql\n...\n\ninterface Character {\n  name: String!\n}\n\ntype Human implements Character {\n  homePlanet: String\n}\n\ntype Droid implements Character {\n  primaryFunction: String\n}\n\n...\n```\n\nWhenever a field of type `Character` is encountered, it could be either a Human or Droid. Human and Droid objects\nwill have a different set of fields. Within your application code, when interacting with a `Character` you'll want to make sure to handle both of these cases.\n\nGiven this query:\n\n```graphql\nquery Characters {\n  characters(episode: NEW_HOPE) {\n    name\n\n    ... on Human {\n      homePlanet\n    }\n\n    ... on Droid {\n      primaryFunction\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nApollo Codegen will generate a union type for Character.\n\n```javascript\nexport type CharactersQuery = {\n  characters: Array<\n    | {\n        __typename: \"Human\",\n        name: string,\n        homePlanet: ?string\n      }\n    | {\n        __typename: \"Droid\",\n        name: string,\n        primaryFunction: ?string\n      }\n  >\n};\n```\n\nThis type can then be used as follows to ensure that all possible types are handled:\n\n```javascript\nfunction CharacterFigures({ characters }: CharactersQuery) {\n  return characters.map(character => {\n    switch (character.__typename) {\n      case \"Human\":\n        return (\n          <HumanFigure\n            homePlanet={character.homePlanet}\n            name={character.name}\n          />\n        );\n      case \"Droid\":\n        return (\n          <DroidFigure\n            primaryFunction={character.primaryFunction}\n            name={character.name}\n          />\n        );\n    }\n  });\n}\n```\n\n# Contributing\n\n[![Build Status](https://circleci.com/gh/apollographql/apollo-tooling.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/apollographql/apollo-tooling)\n\nThis repo is composed of multiple packages managed by Lerna. The `apollo-cli` contains the core CLI commands. The `apollo-codegen-core` package contains all the compiler APIs needed to implement code generation support for new languages. The other `apollo-codegen-*` packages implement code generation support for individual languages.\n\nRunning tests locally:\n\n```\nnpm install\nnpm test\n```\n\nYou can also run `npm` commands within package folders after you have bootstrapped the repository (part of `npm install`).\n\n> Note: if you have issues, try `npm run clean && npm i` to get a fresh install of the packages. Occasionally problems arise when removed dependencies stay around\n\n## Nock tests\n\nTo display the debugging messages for nock, run the following command:\n\n```bash\nDEBUG=nock.* npm test\n```\n\nIt can also be helpful to print standard out during testing. To enable logging, add the following configuration to the `stdout` function call during test creation:\n\n```\n.stdout({ print: true })\n```\n\n## Active Development / Debugging\n\nTo simplify the development process, you may want to step through and debug commands whose behavior you're modifying. To do this, run the executable with node in debug mode like so, where `<command>` is a valid CLI command like `client:check` or `service:push`:\n\n```\nnode --inspect-brk=9002 packages/apollo/bin/run <command>\n```\n\nIf you're using VS Code, you can run the included \"Attach to CLI Debugger\" launch task and debug right from VS Code! Otherwise, you may use the Chrome inspector or [other Node debugger](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/debugging-getting-started/) of your choice.\n\n## Regenerating Mocked Network Data\n\nSome integration tests rely on mocked server data (service:check for example). Mock data is generated by making real network requests and recording those requests with [`nock`'s recording feature](https://github.com/nock/nock#recording). Stop mocking network calls and add `nock.recorder.rec()` before network calls are made. For `service:check`, change `apiKey` to a real engine API key. Then run the tests and nock will output code to mock requests to the console. You can (and probably should) pare down the request to be less brittle (by only checking for an operation name, for example). See [`src/commands/service/__tests__/check.test.ts`](./packages/apollo/src/commands/service/__tests__/check.test.ts) for an example of how a mocked network request will look.\n\n\n## Publishing\n\n1. Make sure the `CHANGELOG.md` is updated with all changes committed since the last release. Make sure the versions for each package to update are correct, and there's a blank `Upcoming` section for future work.\n2. Run `npm run release:version-bump -- <bumpish>`\n   - Can use major, minor, patch, prepatch, etc for the bump type. If not used, the command will prompt and ask for the bump type.\n   - This command updates git tags locally and on GitHub\n3. Run npm run release:start-ci-publish locally\n   - Pushes a `publish/XXXXXXXXXX` tag to GitHub to trigger circle CI build\n4. Circle will notify the appropriate Apollo team slack channel when ready to release\n   - Slack channel member will confirm through the Apollo Deploy Bot\n   - Circle will release to all channels (npm, cli binary to s3, vscode marketplace)\n   - Another slack bot notification will confirm success of release.\n\n## Maintainers\n\n- [@JakeDawkins](https://github.com/jakedawkins) (Apollo)\n",
