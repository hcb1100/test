We strongly\n> encourage developers to contact Apollo Graph Manager support to discuss their use\n> case prior to building their own reporting agent using this module.\n\nThis module provides JavaScript/TypeScript\n[Protocol buffer](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) definitions\nfor the Apollo Graph Manager reporting API.  These definitions are generated for\nconsumption from the `reports.proto` file which is defined internally within\nApollo.\n\n## Development\n\n> **Note:** Due to a dependency on Unix tools (e.g. `bash`, `grep`, etc.), the\n> development of this module requires a Unix system.  There is no reason why\n> this can't be avoided, the time just hasn't been taken to make those changes.\n> We'd happily accept a PR which makes the appropriate changes!\n\nCurrently, this package generates a majority of its code with\n[`protobufjs`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/protobufjs) based on the\n`reports.proto` file. The output is generated with the `prepare` npm script.\n\nThe root of the repository provides the `devDependencies` necessary to build\nthese definitions (e.g. `pbjs`, `pbts`, `protobuf`, etc.) and the `prepare`\nnpm script is invoked programmatically via the monorepo tooling (e.g. Lerna)\nthanks to _this_ module's `postinstall` script.   Therefore, when making\nchanges to this module, `npx lerna run prepare` should be run from the **root**\nof this monorepo in order to update the definitions in _this_ module.\n",
