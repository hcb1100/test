    "readme": "# Apollo Tracing (for Node.js)\n\nThis package is used to collect and expose trace data in the [Apollo Tracing](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-tracing) format.\n\nIt relies on instrumenting a GraphQL schema to collect resolver timings, and exposes trace data for an individual request under `extensions` as part of the GraphQL response.\n\nThis data can be consumed by [Apollo Graph Manager](https://www.apollographql.com/platform/) (previously, Apollo Engine) or any other tool to provide visualization and history of field-by-field execution performance.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Apollo Server\n\nApollo Server includes built-in support for tracing from version 1.1.0 onwards.\n\nThe only code change required is to add `tracing: true` to the options passed to the `ApolloServer` constructor options for your integration of choice. For example, for [`apollo-server-express`](https://npm.im/apollo-server-express):\n\n```javascript\nconst { ApolloServer } = require('apollo-server-express');\n\nconst server = new ApolloServer({\n  schema,\n  tracing: true,\n});\n```\n",
